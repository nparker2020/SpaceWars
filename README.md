# SpaceWars
A asteroids-inspired 2D game using OpenGL


Disclaimer:

This game may not function properly anymore due to the time that has passed since I ceased working on this project.
This game is built on the Slick2D libray like many other projects of mine.

The library can be downloaded here: http://slick.ninjacave.com/

Features included:

-"pickups" that randomly spawn around the field giving the player a temporary ability.
i.e. a giant laser that can sweep the entire screen eliminating everything in its path:

Or missiles that will track the closest enemy until a target is hit:

Or, a shield that can deflect lasers shot by other players:
